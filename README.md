# Goldfuscate
## **Goldfuscate, personalize the player model!**
Goldfuscate is a MCreator plugin adding the possibility to use Obfuscate, a library created by [MrCrayfish](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/Obfuscate/), a powerful API to make custom animations on the player's model. I decided to make this plugin after reading the MrScautHD's tutorial, so users hating the code or don't want to code can use Obfuscate easily.

##Short tutorial:

1. When you have your procedure, you have to select the new global trigger called "Setup rotations of the player - Obfuscate". This will allow Obfuscate to know how to execute the code.

2. To be executed, the trigger needs a condition. The trigger allows you to use the entity dependency. Check the image for an example

This plugin adds 2 new procedure blocks allowing you to make everything. The first procedure block (see the image below) allow you to get a value of a part of the player model. The second block is the block used to change a value of a part of the model.
