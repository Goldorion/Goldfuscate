# Goldfuscate
Goldfuscate is a MCreator plugin adding the possibility to use Posture, a library created by [MrCrayfish](https://github.com/MrCrayfish/Posture), a powerful API to make custom animations on the player's model.

## Short tutorial:

1. When you have your procedure, you have to select the new global trigger called "Setup rotations of the player - Posture".
2. This will allow Posture to know how to execute the code.

This plugin adds 2 new procedure blocks allowing you to make everything. The first procedure block (see the image below) allow you to get a value of a part of the player model. The second block is the block used to change a value of a part of the model.
